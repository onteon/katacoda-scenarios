# CLI

In the previous step you learned to use the web console panel to start a microservice deployed to Onteon node. Now you'll see an alternative, programmatic approach to the same task. Your task will be to follow the instructions and start the microservice using the terminal.

## Starting the service using CLI

1. Start the control CLI:

  `/opt/jlupin/platform/start/control.sh`{{execute}}

  ![CLI started](assets/cli-start.png)

2. List the microservices:

  `microservice status`{{execute}}

  ![Missing microservice](assets/cli-missing-service.png)

3. Notice which service is not running and start it:

  `microservice start currency-converter-eur`{{execute}}

4. After several seconds you'll se the confirmation in the console that the service started:

  ![Service started](assets/cli-notification.png)

5. List all microservices again:

  `microservice status`{{execute}}

  ![Service started](assets/cli-complete-list.png)

## Test

Open the [exchange application](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/exchange/) once again and see that now the conversion all currencies are converted correctly.
